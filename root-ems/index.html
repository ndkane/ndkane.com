		<h2>Thoughts on Webfonts</h2>

		<p>As you can see, I’ve changed the font on this site from Palatino Linotype. We were very comfortable together at first, however, after noticing many flaws, we decided to call it a day. Palatino Linotype looks lovely and bookish at first, but it has terrible curly quotes, and ultimately didn’t reflect the tone I wanted to convey by writing these posts. I wanted to try something a little more friendly, so I had a look at web fonts.</p>

		<p>I’d already learned how to load in Google webfonts when I created my page to experiment with <a href="/relative-sizing">ems and root ems in the CSS</a>. Loading in a Google webfont is a simple matter of loading in the stylesheet (which is provided by Google webfonts) and assigning the font-family of the elements that I wanted to apply it to. However, as I found out, there are more web fonts in life than just Google web fonts.</p>

		<p>Before choosing the current web font, I had a sift through the Google Web fonts directory. I’ve spoken to many web developers and designers who have made it pretty clear that the selection isn’t particularly exciting. I found one rather beautiful site by <a href="https://twitter.com/ubuwaits" title="Chad Mazzola (ubuwaits) on Twitter">Chad Mazzola</a> on <a href="http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/" title="Beautiful web type &amp;mdash; the best typefaces from the Google web fonts directory">Hello Happy</a> that utilises the best examples and combinations from the Google web font directoy, such as the above example in <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Playfair+Display#pairings" title="Google Web Fonts Playfair Display">Playfair Display.</a> I eventually landed on <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Galdeano">Galdeano</a> for my headlines and navigation, and <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Gudea">Gudea</a> for all other text. I chose this pairing because I wanted typography that was clear and friendly, which at first I thought this pairing was.</p>

		<p>Once I’d got over the initial novelty of loading in web fonts, I realised I didn’t really like my choice very much. As Aral pointed out, I’d also managed to choose another font that had terrible curly quotes. This was a point where critique was important, something that Aral has encouraged throughout our lessons. Aral drew my attention to the functional side of web fonts; what they were designed for and how they should be best used. He pointed out that the spaces (tracking) between letters was very large and made the text difficult to read. As the description reads, Gudea was designed for instructions and labels, and therefore the larger tracking helped when the font size was reduced. Galdeano also had flaws, such as the very symettrical dot (tittle) above the ‘i’, which didn’t match the asymmetrical design of the rest of the type. This left me in a bit of a muddle.</p>

		<p>I asked two friends that are particularly ace at typography, <a href="https://twitter.com/alicaurusrex" title="Alice Ralph (alicaurusrex) on Twitter">Alice Ralph</a> and <a href="http://laurakalbag.com" title="Laura Kalbag">Laura Kalbag</a>, for their advice. I was pointed in the direction of TypeKit by Adobe which allows you to create a ‘kit’ of types to load in via a very simple js script. It makes it rather simple to search for fonts that would suit paragraphs and headlines, and it has a rather lovely selection. I’m currently using the free version until I invest in the portfolio, hence the teeny grey badge in the corner.</p>

		<p>The font you see before you is called <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/adelle-web" title="Adelle | Typekit">Adelle</a>, which I found friendly, readable, and had a great amount of character which is what I originally set out to find. I’d love to learn a lot more about typography, web fonts and design, so if you recommend any articles or books I should read, please <a href="mailto:nataliedenisekane@gmail.com">email me</a>, or say hello on <a href="http://twitter.com/nd_kane" title="Natalie Kane (nd_kane) on Twitter">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://alpha.app.net/nataliekane" title="nataliekane on App.net">App.net</a>!</p>
