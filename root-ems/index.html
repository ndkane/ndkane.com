		<h2>Thoughts on Web fonts</h2>

		<p>As you can see, I’ve changed the font on this site from Palatino Linotype. We were very comfortable together at first, however, after noticing many flaws, I decided to call it a day. Palatino Linotype looks lovely and bookish at first, but it has terrible curly quotes, and ultimately didn’t reflect the tone I wanted to convey in these posts. I wanted to try something a little more friendly, so I had a look at web fonts.</p>

		<p>I’d already learned how to load in Google web fonts when I created my page to experiment with <a href="/relative-sizing">ems and root ems in the CSS</a>. Loading in a Google web font is a simple matter of loading in the stylesheet (which is provided by Google webfonts) and assigning the font-family of the elements that you wanted to apply it to. However, as I found out, there are more web fonts in life than just Google web fonts.</p>

		<img src="images/hello-happy-type-example.png">

		<p>Before choosing the current web font, I had a sift through the Google Web fonts directory. I spoke to many web developers and designers who have made it pretty clear that the selection isn’t particularly exciting. I found one rather beautiful site by <a href="https://twitter.com/ubuwaits" title="Chad Mazzola (ubuwaits) on Twitter">Chad Mazzola</a> on <a href="http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/" title="Beautiful web type &amp;mdash; the best typefaces from the Google web fonts directory">Hello Happy</a> that utilises the best examples and combinations from the Google web font directoy, such as the above example in <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Playfair+Display#pairings" title="Google Web Fonts Playfair Display">Playfair Display.</a></p>

		<p>I eventually landed on <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Galdeano">Galdeano</a> for my headlines and navigation, and <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Gudea">Gudea</a> for all other text. I chose this pairing because I wanted typography that was clear and friendly, which I thought this pairing was.</p>

		<figure><img class="diagram" src="images/Gudea-screenshot.png"><figcaption>An example of the Google Web Font Gudea</figcaption></figure>

		<p>Once I got over the initial novelty of loading in web fonts, I realised I didn’t really like my choice very much. As Aral pointed out, I also managed to choose another font that had terrible curly quotes. This was a point where critique was important, something that Aral has encouraged throughout our lessons.</p> 

		<p>Aral drew my attention to the functional side of web fonts; what they were designed for and how they should be best used. He pointed out that the spaces (tracking) between letters in Gudea was very large and made the text difficult to read. As the description reads, Gudea was designed for instructions and labels, and therefore the larger tracking helped when the font size was reduced. Galdeano also had flaws, such as the very symettrical dot (tittle) above the ‘i’, which didn’t match the asymmetrical design of the rest of the type. This left me in a bit of a muddle.</p>

		<figure><img src="images/typekit-screenshot.png"><figcaption>An screenshot of the TypeKit UI</figcaption></figure>

		<p>I asked two friends that are particularly ace at typography, <a href="https://twitter.com/alicaurusrex" title="Alice Ralph (alicaurusrex) on Twitter">Alice Ralph</a> and <a href="http://laurakalbag.com" title="Laura Kalbag">Laura Kalbag</a>, for their advice. They pointed me in the direction of TypeKit by Adobe which allows you to create a ‘kit’ of types to load in via a JavaScript. It makes it rather simple to search for fonts that would suit paragraphs and headlines, and it has a rather lovely selection. I’m currently using the free version until I invest in the portfolio, hence the teeny grey badge in the corner.</p>

		<p>The font you see before you is called <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/adelle-web" title="Adelle | Typekit">Adelle</a>. It is friendly, readable, and has a great amount of character (which is what I originally set out to find). Through Twitter, I discoverd <a href="http://beta.typecardsapp.com" title="Type Cards">Typecard</a>, an app that takes you through different elements in typography in a rather delightful way. It also allows you to search for terms too! I’d love to learn a lot more about typography, web fonts and design, so if you can recommend any articles or books I should read, please <a href="mailto:nataliedenisekane@gmail.com">email me</a>, or say hello on <a href="http://twitter.com/nd_kane" title="Natalie Kane (nd_kane) on Twitter">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://alpha.app.net/nataliekane" title="nataliekane on App.net">App.net</a>!</p> 

		<h2>Root ems</h2>

		<p>As you may have noticed, last week I struggled with ems. Even after I got the hang of them, they still weren’t very simple to comprehend. This is where I was introduced to root ems, or rems in short.</p>

		<p>Unlike ems, root ems are always relative to the root element’s font size. Whereas ems inherit their values from the context, the parent element, root ems are always relative to the font size of the root element. So if the <code>html</code> <code>font-size</code> is set at 16px, then 1 rem will always equal 16px, regardless of the context in which it is used.</p>
<figure><pre><code class="language-css">html
{
	font-size: 10px;
}

body
{
	font-size: 2rem; /* = 20px */
	margin-left: 1rem; /* = 10px */
}

p
{
	font-size: 4rem; /* = 40px */
	margin: 8rem; /* = 80px */
}</code></pre><figcaption>An example of root ems used within the html.</figcaption></figure>

		<p>As demonstrated above, if the <code>html</code> <code>font-size</code> is set at 10px, the value of 1<code>rem</code> equals 10px. If the <code>body</code> sets the <code>font-size</code> at 2<code>rem</code>, the margins set within it are not relative to the parent element, but to the root, and therefore 1<code>rem</code> still remains at 10px. This also applies to any element within the <code>body</code>, such as the <code>p</code> element, which also inherits its value from the root, rather than the parent element, the <code>body</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">@media all and (min-width: 768px)
{
	html
	{
	font-size 24px
	}

	body
	{
		max-width 31.25rem /* 750px/24 */
		margin-left auto
		margin-right auto
	}

}</code></pre>

		<p>With media queries, as each element is relative to the root font-size, you don’t need to have a long list of instructions to your elements for when the design breaks. Instead, you simply have to define the root font size in the <code>html</code>, which overrides the current root font size. This is because all elements will then be relative to this root font size, and scale accordingly.</p>

		<p>As you can see, this is pretty simple to grasp, however, as values become decimal it becomes quite difficult to visualise things and it still requires a bit of maths. For example, if your base font size is set at 16px, and your margin is set at 24px, you will have to work out what this is in rems by dividing 24px by 16px. This leaves you with 1.5<code>rem</code>. As you can imagine, when values are divided and numbers after the decimal point become longer, it becomes really hard to visualise your design, as not everyone is a genius with numbers (certainly not me).</p>

		<h2>Pixel-parity root ems</h2>

		<p>Now, root ems are all well and good, however you can’t really visualise root ems easily. However, you can visualise pixels, so Aral introduced me to a new way of thinking about using root ems. Aral has written a really good post on <a href="http://aralbalkan.com/notes/pixel-parity-rems/" title="Aral Balkan&amp;#8202;—&amp;#8202;Pixel‐parity rems">pixel-parity rems</a> over on his blog, which may explain this in a better way than I can!</p>

		<p>Chris Jacob suggested a simple solution in his <a href="http://jsbin.com/acide4/8" title="ROOT EM! Using CSS3 "rem" Units for "Elastic Pixels"">Elastic Pixels gist</a>. Aral then takes it further. What if 1rem was equal to 1px? If the base font size is set at 1px, then 1rem will equal 1px. So, rather than dividing values by the root which has a value larger than 1px&#8202;—&#8202;resulting in a lot of ridiculous decimal numbers&#8202;—&#8202;you can set the font size in the html to 1px. This means that to set a <code>margin-left</code> value that equals 500px, as the root font size set in the <code>html</code> is 1px, you only have to set the value as 500rems. This makes design a whole lot easier to visualise, as it’s much easier to imagine in pixels.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">@media all and (min-width: 768px)
{
	html
	{
	font-size 1.5px
	}

	body
	{
		max-width 500rem /* 750px/1.5 */
		margin-left auto
		margin-right auto
	}

}</code></pre>

		<p>As demonstrated above, A root font size has to be set in a media query. This is because I have set a larger root font size for when the design breaks. In the above example, I 
		As 16px is equal to 1 rem, in order to gain a root font size of 1.5rem, you will have to multiply 16 by 1.5. So, in order to set a root font size of 24px when your design breaks, you will have to set the root font size to 1.5rem. You’ll also notice that I have had to change the max width of the <code>body</code>&#8202;—&#8202;as the root font size has changed, I have to do a little bit of math to determine what my max width would be in rems, if the root font size was 1.5px instead of 1px.</p>

		<p>The one problem that both Aral and Chris Jacobs point out is that not all browsers support rems, such as IE8 and Opera Mini. I’ll have to ask Aral in my next solution how I would create a fallback option for this.</p>

		<img src="images/Accessibility-font-limit.png">

		<p>There is also a problem with Accessibility, as shown above. When you go into Safari Preferences, under the ‘Advanced’ tab there is an option to stop the display of fonts with a size less than 9px. This means that this option goes to each element and checks the font-size. If the value is set less than 9px, then it sets the font size of every element (including the <code>html</code>, the root font size) at 9px, causing everything to scale accordingly. With a root font size set at 1px, you can see why this would be a problem. Aral has stressed that setting the root font-size to 1px is not the way to make your site easily to visualise and responsive. However, it is one interation on our way to pixel parity rems which we will address next week!</p>
