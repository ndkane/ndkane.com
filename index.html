		<h1>Hi, I’m Natalie, Nice to Meet You.</h1>

		<p>I should probably start by introducing myself. My name is Natalie, and I wear many hats. I am an Artist, an Arts Facilitator, a Project Manager and Curator. I am very curious, love learning new things, and up for a challenge. I also like Cats, Science and Bees, but that's for another time. This blog is an record of my lessons with <a href="http://aralbalkan.com">Aral Balkan</a> learning Content Out Web Development and Design. You can see his lessons, and his experience of teaching me, by visiting his <a href="http://contentoutweb.com">website</a>. I promise that his account of this process make much more sense than my ramblings!</a></p>
