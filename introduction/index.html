		<h2>So why am I doing this?</h2>

		<p>I love web design, but so far only from a user’s perspective. I love complaining about rubbish websites, and I love talking about really excellent ones. I wanted to know why this was, and why I found it easier to use certain websites, and why I was right to be frustrated at terrible ones. Many of my friends are web developers, and to tell you the truth, I was envious.</p>

		<h2>Where I will stumble. Almost definitely.</h2>

		<p>I’m not very good at maths. Even though I managed a healthy B grade at GCSE, I’m pretty sure 90% of it was mindless regurgitation. I think it’s safe to say that I was turned off maths at a very early age. I still count things with my fingers, and the most advanced sums I do is figuring out how to get a note rather than a pocketful of change at Small Batch. However, as I grew older, and my love and passion for science grew, I realised that all of the concepts I admired had a basic rooting in science. This was my main worry when I first even thought about starting this. I was even tempted to take a BBC Bitesize GCSE maths test to see how rusty I was, but fear of failure prevented me from even taking that step.</p>

		<p>I like to think about this journey as being similar to learning a language. As it happens, I’m learning Danish, and I have found there is a line of similarity between learning languages and learning web development. Both are based in behaviours, both can be taught or learnt differently to varying effects (Native Speaker versus Google Translate), and once learnt, it becomes second nature. I know this all sounds ridiculous, but I’m hoping it's a healthy approach to learning something that I would otherwise feel intimidated by.</p>

		<p>So, off I go, Ønsk mig held og lykke! (Wish me Luck!)</p>
