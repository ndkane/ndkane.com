		<h1>Fixing Things, Learning Some Class and Getting Mobile</h1>

		<h2>Images</h2>

		<p>As mentioned in my previous lesson, there were a few things that needed fixing, and a few questions that needed answering. My website was taking on a life of its own, and I had to make sure that it was going to behave how I wanted it to, unlike Fritz Lang’s robot double in the 1927 film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(film)" title="Link to Metropolis on Wikipedia.">‘Metropolis’</a> (pictured above). Here’s hoping it will be a force for good.</p> 

		<p>The first issue concerned the image that I included in the post — How to host images myself so that I didn’t have to hotlink (which is naughty, as it steals bandwidth!), how to credit images properly, and how to make it the right size.</p>

		<p>Hosting an image was simple, and made sense once the connection had been made. It was as simple as creating an Images folder in the folder where that page was kept, and linking it using the img src code back to the location in the root directory. As the image was from Flickr (with a Creative Commons license, I do aim to be good...) I wanted to make sure that credit was given. Aral gave me a very handy, very easy tip to remembering the location of an image on the internets using the comments tag within the code. This is not only very helpful to a forgetful being like myself, but also shows consideration from the web developer/designer; It shows a degree of care about your source, and gives credit where credit is due! I also saved the file with the creators name attached, and added a title to the image for accessibility.</p>

		<p>When I first placed the image, it was definitely a case of guesswork on what width I should use. Guessing the width at 550px, I added the width attribute into the img tag. This worked initially, but as Aral pointed out, what happens when the page is resized? Aside from the text not responding to the width of the window, the image was just cut off. Aral asked me what size my image should be at all times in context to the window size. My instinct was to guess the total size of the image, then just guess the proportionate size, for example, a slightly smaller window would be at 75%. I was promptly told off for this… The image should be at 100% at all times, so therefore within the css, we set the max-width of the image to 37.5 ems, the max-width of the text, and the width at a permanant 100%, so wherever the image was moved to, it would stay the same. Problem solved, and no-one was beheaded.</p>

		<h2>Taking things mobile</h2>

		<p>If you’d tried to look at ndkane.com on a mobile, you would have been confronted with tiny little writing that no-one could read. After installing XCode, a handy free developer app that comes with an iOS simulator, Aral told me about viewports. 
		We added the content attribute ‘width=device-width’ to the head, after the viewport meta tag, which tells the code to fit to the width of the device. Simple, it’s wonderful what asking nicely will do for you. Now my friends with Android and Windows phones will have to endure a brief takeover every now and again as I test my fledgling website on them. Sorry in advance.</p>

		<h2>Staying Classy</h2>

		<p>In last week’s post I identified a few questions that I wanted to ask Aral concerning the formatting of the post. How did I make it so that one rule I laid out in the style sheet did not apply to everything, such as my problem with lists where I didn’t want all lists to have an alphabetical value? This was all solved by understanding class attributes. I’ll be honest, at first I didn’t fully grasp what an attribute was, so after some very helpful repetition (including ‘Create PinkElephant class’) from Aral I finally got it. In the case of bullet points, it is a case of making a particular rule, rather than an exception to one which was my first instinct.</p>

		<p>Within the ‘ol’ element in the stylesheet, I created the class ‘alphabetical-list’. By keeping it within this element, with ‘.’ to indicate a class, this rule only applies to this class when identified within an ordered list. This applies across the board to all elements and class attributes. Therefore if you only wanted a certain font when selected, rather than applying it to the whole code, you would be able to create a class for this tag, and then identify it as a class attribute.</p>

		<h2>Footnotes: A little padding never hurts</h2>

		<p>In my previous posts I had footnotes, however in order for you to reference them, you had to scroll all the way to the bottom of the page. Therefore Aral taught me about ID’s. These are a series of markers that indicate within the pages’s code where to jump to. Although at first this was a bit tricky for me, I finally understood. Using the ‘a’ tag, I created a link, then an ‘href’ attribute using the # to indicate a link within the code — the direction. Then at the point that I wanted to jump to, at the footnote, I created the actual id using the ‘id’ attribute — the location. This also allowed me to link back to the point of origin within the post, so that once you reached the footnote you could get back!</p>

		<p>Another thing about my footnotes was the presentation of the in—text references. Like my problem with ordered lists, I noticed that I wanted to create another rule for this. The first rule was that I didn’t want the superscript (teeny) ‘1’ to be underlined. Therefore, I created another class specific to the ‘a’ tag and titled it ‘footnote’ and indicated that I wanted zero text decoration. This means that when I want this I can apply it when creating a link to ensure it isn’t underlined.</p>

		<p>I also had to create a class for the tiny ‘1’ that indicated a footnote. I first used the unicode symbol for this, however it only seemed to work for certain numbers, and therefore wasn’t very useful if I wanted to use other numbers instead! Aral showed me to make a class that indicated a smaller script. It had to be smaller, and its position relative to the text size, and in order for it to be smaller than the text I had to give a minus em value. Just in case that doesn't mmake sense, here’s the code in the stylesheet:

		<figure> <img src="images/footnote-class-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Footnotes code within CC Stylesheet"> <figcaption>Footnote class indicating a small, relative number to use within text.</figcaption> </figure>

		<p>The presentation of the footnotes was also important. I had previously learnt the border tag when I learned about ordered lists, and therefore it was easy enough to create one. However, the problem arose of how to add the footnotes and in this case, the credits, on without making it look like an unholy mess? This is when Aral told me about margins and padding. The padding was the distance around the text, while the margin was the distance outside the text. Therefore I adjusted this, however I think I’m going to play with it a little more.</p>

		<!--Add sketched images of padding/margins?-->

		<h2>A quick note on relativity</h2>

		<p>When I have been writing these blog posts, often I find myself falling into the inevitable trap of presentation, rather than semantics. This is what happens when you’re used to writing a certain way at school, and therefore eliminate any other way of writing anything in text. Aral pointed out the importance of marking up for semantics, not presentation in web design and development, as that’s what code is for, and the style sheet. I have already made the mistake of thinking that ‘h1’, ‘h2’ etc. are smaller and bigger versions of a heading, rather than relative tags.</p>

		<h2>Other matters of great importance</h2>

		<p>I’ve made my text justified, so that it reads slightly better, Aral also showed me the super useful hyphens tag to insert into the stylesheet within the ‘p’ tag, which stops rivers in the text appearing as it all stretches to fit in.</p>

		<p>Also, I hope you like my shiny new navigation page. Nothing says frustration like having to click ‘next’ five or so times just to get to the page you want. It’s still very simple, so bear with me! I’ll also be adding a little illustration once I get hold of a scanner.</p>

		<p>For the meantime, I hope you all had a higher level of pancakes in you than normal this week, and you’re taking advantage of the sunshine!</p>

		<p>Indil næste uge,</p>
