		<h1>Art and Code</h1>

		<p>Is it important for artists to know how to code?</p>

		<p>This is an almost relentless conversation I have had with several people, from artists to programmers, designers to curators, which often finds people sitting on both sides of the fence. These are worlds that have slowly started to collide, however there is still a lot of room for misunderstanding, misinterpretation, and downright confusion.</p>

		<p>The problem is essentially simple; If artists create work that requires code or programming, should they bring in someone to do it for them, or code it themselves? Digital art has existed since the 1970s, however we’ve seen it creep further into the foreground. Festivals such as <a href="http://www.brightondigitalfestival.co.uk" title="Brighton Digital Festival 2013">Brighton Digital Festival</a>, <a href="http://www.northeastofnorth.com" title="Home - NEoN Digital Arts Festival">NEoN</a>, and <a href="http://re-new.org" title="RE-NEW DIGITAL ARTS FESTIVAL">re-new</a> have created new platforms for the digital arts, and undergraduate and postgraduate degrees are emerging, allowing artists to use technology as a material. However, it’s not necessarily digital art that is the problem here, but rather using digital technologies in art.</p>

		<p>Now it’s not my place to name and shame, hence why I won’t be naming any artists that have used technology in their work without understanding what it’s doing. I’m also not saying that artists should know absolutely everything about their materials. A painter doesn’t need to know how to make paint in order to apply it to a canvas, in the same way a digital artist doesn’t need to know how to create a programming language in order to use JavaScript to create work.</p>

		<p>I would like to say that code is an exciting thing, and creating generative work with code and data is a very exciting thing. However, a working comprehension of it should be there. It’s a terrible thing to feel like you can’t really connect to your work, or that you’re missing a step, because you didn’t quite create it.</p>

		<p>Whether artists should understand, or produce their own digital work is rooted in an older question than you think. A tension has always existed in the art community concerning whether artists should create work without the assistance of others, and if they use help, should they share the credit? For generations artists have used other people to realise their visions, from Antony Gormley’s figures to Damien Hirst’s dot paintings. However, in my opinion, Gormley’s work still has a particularly close relationship with Gormley himself.</p> 

		<figure><img class="text-wrap-right" src="images/gormley-cast-1994.jpg"><figcaption class="text-wrap-right">Antony Gormley, from Expansion Works 1994.</figcaption></figure>

		<p>Each figure created for his installation at Southbank was cast by Gormley himself, where he sat for hours encased in plaster to create the moulds for his haunting, meditative sculptures. The casts were filled by assistants as a logistical solution, unlike Hirst, who used hundreds of assistants to paint dots and dots and dots with nothing but a colour pattern. This process is hollow and disconnected, which may have been the point, but it doesn’t make it good art. You can tell I’m not Hirst’s biggest fan.</p>

		<p>Successful relationships can be built between programmer and artist, but without speaking the same language, everything else will be lost in translation. How can you explain something you don’t understand yourself? How can you feel that work is truly yours if it remains a mystery to you? What about the children? Ahem.</p>

		<p>I’d really like to hear your comments on this, even if you think I’m being a digital primadonna. <a href="mailto:hello@ndkane.com">Email me</a>, or fill my <a href="http://twiter.com/nd_kane">Twitter</a> timeline with sarcastic remarks on how wrong I am.</p>
