		<h1>About this Site</h2>

		<p>This website was designed as part of my journey into Content Out Web Development and Design, taught by <a href="http://aralbalkan.com" title="Aral Balkan">Aral Balkan</a>. It’s created completely from scratch, which means everything you see before you has been lovingly crafted over many weeks of learning. No doubt it will change in the future, but for now, here’s a few notes on its design.</p>

		<h2>Typography</h2>

		<p>The type that I used to design my site anchor is <a href="http://www.ffonts.net/SuastOrnad-tfb.font.viewreview" title="SuastOrnad tfb Font Comments">SuasOrnad TFB</a> by Kaiser Zharkan, and I am using <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/adelle-web" title="Adelle | Typekit">Adelle</a> by Typekit for the main body of text. I chose Adelle because it is friendly, readable, and has a wonderful, open personality.</p>

		<h2>Colour Palette</h2>

		<p>I am a big fan of Blue (not the band). One of my favourite colours is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Klein_Blue" title="International Klein Blue - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">International Klein Blue</a> by Yves Klein, which represents the thought and consideration that should be taken when thinking about colour. Many moons ago I read that blue is the colour of thinking and of contemplation, which I tend to agree with. This is why I chose blue to be the accent colour of this simple, yet thought-filled site.</p>

		<h2>So, why all of the horror movie stills?</h2>

		<p>If you haven’t already noticed, I have a slight obsession with Horror films of the 1930s, particularly those of James Whale. As well as being in love with the aesthetics of these gothic, elaborate masterpieces, I’ve always linked them to the tensions of the new, the worries of change and the exploration of the unfamiliar. Horror narratives often reveal the tensions of the period they were created in, with anxieties hidden in plain sight. When industry started to take over Victorian England, Gothic fiction provided a narrative from which to explore the fear of technology by creating monsters either manmade or from our imaginations, such as Mary Shelley’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein" title="Frankenstein - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Frankenstein</a>, or Bram Stoker’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula" title="Dracula - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Dracula</a>.</p>

		<p>Majority of the films I’ve featured in my posts have been the films of James Whale. James Whale is a personal favourite of mine, who found ways to quietly explore the queer identity through the monsters in his films. Whale’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein_(1931_film)" title="Frankenstein (1931 film) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Frankenstein</a> is the awkward, imperfect embodiment of The Monster, unjustly ostracised by society yet created in the image of his creator. Religious allegories aside, James Whale’s characters were extraordinary individuals, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invisible_Man_(1933_film)" title="The Invisible Man (film) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">The Invisible Man</a>, who sought acceptance where they often never found it. Whale was a quiet, openly gay individual who wouldn’t let his sexuality define his work, however his sad, tragic, yet  ridiculous characters often revealed an individual that often felt out-of-place.</p>

		<p>You could say I’ve been using horror movies as a metaphor for my own fears and tensions. Learning something which I imagined to be outside of my immediate experience has brought up some old demons, such as the struggle my younger self had with maths. However, this journey has turned out to be the light at the end of a strange and wonderful tunnel. I have been learning to take more risks, and ask for help when you’ve run out of bullets.</p>
