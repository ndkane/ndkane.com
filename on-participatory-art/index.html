		<h1>On Participatory Art and the Institution</h1>

		<time datetime="2013-02-22">February 22nd, 2013</time>

		<p>Earlier in February I attended the Tate Modern Symposium <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/conference/politics-social-contemporary-art" title="The politics of the social in contemporary art | Tate">‘The politics of the social in contemporary art’</a>. Apart from being rather enraged and disillusioned by the remarkably arrogant Renzo Martens (which I will leave for another day to talk about), an important argument was raised about the relationship of the Art Institution and the artist to their audience, specifically through participatory art. This was presented by Beka Economopoulos of <a href="http://www.fissionstrategy.com" title="Fission Strategy’s website">Fission Strategy</a> and <a href="http://notanalternative.com" title="Not An Alternative’s Blog">Not An Alternative</a>, an art collective that stage interventions and use the institution in order to question advertising, architecture, exhibit design, branding, and public relations.</p>

		<p>One of the points raised by Beka was the fatal communication shortfall that occurs within participatory art on an audience level. The example raised to demonstrate this is Rirkrit Tiravanija’s installation <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=147206" title="MoMA | The Collection | Rirkrit Tiravanija. untitled 1992/1995 (free/still). 1992/1995/2007/2011-">Untitled 1992/&shy;1995/&shy;2007/&shy;2011</a>, featured a full scale replication of the artist’s East Village apartment. The intent was to transform the audience into participants by inviting them to eat together with the artist, and inhabit the space as they pleased. However, as evident in Jerry Salz’s observations in ‘A Short History of Rirkrit Tiravanija’<a id="footnote-1-origin" href="#footnote-1" class="footnote">1</a>, the audience perhaps wasn’t as representative as hoped;</p>
			
		<blockquote><p>‘At 303 Gallery I regularly sat with or was joined by a stranger, and it was nice. The gallery became a place for sharing, jocularity and frank talk. I had an amazing run of meals with art dealers. Once I ate with Paula Cooper who recounted a long, complicated bit of professional gossip. Another day, Lisa Spellman related in hilarious detail a story of intrigue about a fellow dealer trying, unsuccessfully, to woo one of her artists. About a week later I ate with David Zwirner. I bumped into him on the street, and he said, “nothing’s going right today, let’s go to Rirkrit’s.” We did, and he talked about a lack of excitement in the New York art world. Another time I ate with Gavin Brown, the artist and dealer . . . who talked about the collapse of SoHo—only he welcomed it, felt it was about time, that the galleries had been showing too much mediocre art. Later in the show’s run, I was joined by an unidentified woman and a curious flirtation filled the air. Another time I chatted with a young artist who lived in Brooklyn who had real insights about the shows he’d just seen.’</p></blockquote>

		<p>As a piece of work that centred on unity, community, and participation, there seemed to be a large proportion of those ‘in the know’ and who’s who mentioned as audience members — Dealers and Artists. Many of the people that an artist may want to interact with may never know it was even there. Beka rightly brought this up in discussion, and presented a rather important point on the nature of the arts institution and participatory art — It is purely a case of access and knowledge, and I completely agree with her. How would those who might benefit from the installation know it was there? Those who live on or below the poverty line may rarely have access to the internet, and almost certainly wouldn’t frequently read art press. You cannot create a participatory piece without considering the audience first, without considering outreach and the unique circumstances that cannot be solved only with marketing.This left Beka, and myself, unconvinced by the work as a truly open dialogue between artist and audience. Now, as a curator and facilitator, this question of participation and a representative audience is critically important in order to make sure contemporary art expands beyond the internalised art world of artists, dealers, and arts professionals. It’s no fun if it’s just us, and will do nothing to change the alienation felt by unfamiliar audiences.</p>

		<p>One particular project that I love, and perfectly negates the distance between participant and artist is Anthony Luvera’s photography series <a href="http://www.luvera.com/old/text/Anthony_Luvera_Photographs.pdf" title="Photographs and Assisted Self Portraits Press Release">’Photographs and Assisted Self Portraits’</a> which was assembled through weekly workshops hosted across London attended by over 200 homeless and ex—homeless people. I saw Anthony speak last year at the Brighton Photo Biennial 2012 Symposium <a href="http://www.bpb.org.uk/2012/whats_on/bpb12-symposium-photographys-contested-spaces/" title="BPB12 Symposium: Contested Spaces - Brighton Photo Biennial 2012">’Photography’s Contested Spaces’,</a> where he presented this project, which facilitates individuals to create their own portfolio and therefore their own representation. Anthony mentioned the time he took before starting the project within the shelter, getting to know the participants and the organisation, an important step to take when seeking to represent a marginalised group. This project sees the artist as facilitator, and directly addressed the participant as collaborator, rather than passive and unrepresentative.</p>

		<p>Looking further at Not An Alternative, it is refreshing to see an art collective asking these questions, and considering the meaning of participatory art after it has undergone academic rigour. In 2010, they created a direct response to Tiravanja’s work <a href="http://www.notanalternative.net/tommorow-is-another-day-after-the-economic-crisis" title="Not An Alternative — Tate Modern: Tommorow Is Another Day (After the Economic Crisis)">‘Tomorrow is Another Day (After the Economic Crisis)’</a>  as part of Tate Modern’s 10th Anniversary show ‘No Souls for Sale: A Festival of Independents’. This ‘house’, with a foreclosure sign prominently displayed amid piles of rubbish, featured a television screen which ‘reports’ Tate Modern’s corporate sponsers in the context of the housing shortage and economic crisis. A harshly critical work on participation and institution, ‘Tomorrow is Another Day’ asked a rather important set of questions that I’d like to finish on; What are the limits of participation? Who gets to participate, and who is left out? </p>
