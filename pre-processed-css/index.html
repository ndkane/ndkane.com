 		<h2>A few experiments</h2>

 		<p>This week I tried to experiment a bit, first by attempting to install and figure out CSS pre-processors myself, and then to try out something completely different. As Aral is currently working on the rather marvellous templating engine <a href="http://tally.jit.su">Tally</a> in Node.js, I have been rather tempted to see if it’s something I would understand. Now, I should make it very clear that I have only started looking over JavaScript this week, so it was a very confusing time, as I tried looking at making a simple site with Node.js, Express, Stylus and Jade. I followed a very simple tutorial by Ben Gourley on Clock’s Blog <a href="http://clock.co.uk/tech-blogs/a-simple-website-in-nodejs-with-express-jade-and-stylus" title="A Simple Website in Node.js with Express, Jade and Stylus by Ben Gourley">‘A Simple Website in Node.js with Express, Jade and Stylus’</a> which led me through it. 

 		<p>Before I started learning with Aral, I had learned many things by clumsily following tutorials, even if I didn’t necessarily understand them. This turned out to be the case here, and as I found out, once again, this was not necessarily the right way for me to learn Node, Express, Jade or Stylus properly. I was very proud that I managed to create a basic site using something I’d never used before, however I can confidently say that I’m not entirely sure how I did so. I encountered many error messages while playing with Node that I didn’t understand, which led to many late night cries for help on Twitter. This was a great indication of how supportive the web community are, as within minutes I recieved help, so a big thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/miksago" title="Micheil Smith (miksago) on Twitter">Micheil Smith</a> for sharing a list of <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/errno.html" title="15.16. errno — Standard errno system symbols &amp;mdash; Python v2.7.4 documentation">errno system messages</a> for future use.</p>

 		<p>Now, don’t get me wrong, most of the people in tech I admire learned this way, however, I think I’ve identified where I’m running a bit too far ahead. As Aral reminded me, I should probably get a grasp on JavaScript first. So apart from writing this, that’s what I’ve been very slowly learning this week while at my day job, just don’t tell my boss. I’ve been using <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net" title="Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming">‘Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming’</a> by Marijn Haverbeke, however, I’ve identified that I am very much a 'doer' when learning anything, so just reading something has meant I’m going at a very slow pace.</p>

 		<h2>Pre-Processed CSS</h2>

 		<p>Before I go into the world of Stylus, I’d like to congratulate myself for not succumbing to any pre-processed dairy or meat jokes when writing this post. It was hard, but I think I’ve reached a level of maturity now where my jokes are a lot more sophisticated, for example, ‘What cheese do you use to lure a bear from a tree?’ ‘Camembert!’ Sorry.</p>

 		<p>Now, last week we encountered a big problem. Just in case you don’t remember, we had set the root font-size to 1px, and them used rems to
