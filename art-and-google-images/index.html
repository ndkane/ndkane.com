		<h1>Art in the age of Google Image Search</h1>

		<time datetime="2013-03-22">March 22nd, 2013</time>

		<p>Now I know it’s a very obvious thing to say, but the way we consume images has dramatically changed since the introduction of Google Image Search. It is hands down the go-to reference point for finding almost any image quickly, however I’ve found it’s caused me a few problems as an artist, curator and teacher.</p>

		<p>I recently had the pleasure of visiting and working with <a href="http://www.saatchionline.com/dongli" title="Portfolio of Dong Li-Blackwell">Dong-Li Blackwell</a>, a wonderfully open watercolour artist from China. Dong uses self-portrait and images of pornography to explore the boundary between public and private, and has a unique perspective on shame, sexuality and cultural differences. She was being interviewed as part of a focus on her work, and over the course of the conversation, Dong was asked for her immediate influences. After listing a few, she couldn’t quite remember the name of one particular artist, only the name of the image. Using Google Image Search, she typed in ‘Christina’s World’.</p>

		<ul class='gallery'> <li><img src='images/bleached-wyeth.jpg' alt="Christina’s World with bleached hues"></li><li><img src='images/dark-wyeth.jpg' alt="Christina’s World with Dark hues"></li><li><img src='images/muted-wyeth.jpg' alt='Christina’s World with muted tones'></li><li><img src='images/duller-wyeth.jpg' alt='Christina’s World with duller hues'></li></ul>

		<p>This brought up a huge range of images of Andrew Wyeth’s iconic work, however, I noticed one inconsistency that has started to bug me. None of the images of the same painting look the same; they are all technically the same, however, there is a spectrum of colour variation in the work that ultimately changes them. Wyeth’s work is noted for his precise attention to colour, partly due to his materials, and partly due to his particular attention to mood. Wyeth used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempera#Egg_tempera" title="Egg Tempera - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Egg tempera</a>, which, as any artist that uses it will tell you, is very difficult to control. You are constantly adding and adjusting as the paint dries, and a lot of care goes into the colour being just right.</p>

		<ul class='gallery'> <li><img src='images/fiery-wyeth.jpg' alt="Christina’s World with fiery hues"></li><li><img src='images/van-gogh-wyeth.jpg' alt="Christina’s World with Van Gogh saturation"></li></ul>

		<p>The muted tones intended by Wyeth transform into fiery, burnt hues (above left), or those similar to those used by Van Gogh (above right), bright and highly saturated. Looking at the images above, it’s hard to make an initial, solid judgement on the work, as the colours vary so dramatically. Gone is Wyeth’s quietly sad, eerily serene portrait of Christina Olson, a painting that arguably belongs to the Southern Gothic movement, where decay is a central theme and the characters within it are inherently flawed, failed by ideals promised by the American Dream. The variety of changes caused by digital reproduction actually change the painting itself.</p>

		<p>The reproduction of work has existed within galleries for years, albeit mainly for commercial purposes; I always find myself purchasing a postcard when I’ve been to an exhibition. However, the reproduction of images on the internet is another thing entirely as more sources are welcomed; from those scanned from a book or from print (which holds its own problems), to user generated images from gallery visits. It’s interesting to note how colour changes across cameras, phones and scanners, but that’s for another day.</p>

		<p>So, how much does the multiple scanning, rescanning, reproduction or accidental manipulation of art have on the experience we have of the art? The much forgotten Google Art Project seeks to bring work to the user without flying the distance, however, how many of us actually consume work in this way? If we want to look up a work as a reference or as a desktop wallpapaer (in my case), we’ll most likely Google it. We’ll then have a choice of images, and we’ll most likely choose the version we prefer, based on our own unconscious tastes. Whether our choice is the true image, or closest to it, doesn’t quite come into the conversation, so should it?</p>

		<p>The difficult questions, and possible (though perhaps not ideal) solutions that arise from this problem are those of the control of an image. If there is only one original, then how much should we control the reproduction? I am a big fan of art being democratic and open, and fully support initiatives to make images available for anyone to download, such as LACMA &#8202;—&#8202; Los Angeles County Museum of Art &#8202;—&#8202; who have made over <a href="http://lacma.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/what-do-cats-have-to-do-with-it-welcome-to-our-new-collections-website/" title="Welcome to Our New Collections Website | The LACMA Blog">20,000 images available</a> to the public for free (albeit only those deemed to be in the public domain). However, as these images are shared and distributed, they will remain more or less the same, as they are from one source.</p>

		<p>This method of image consumption is very idealistic, and perhaps very wrong, as user generated images and those from catalogues and encyclopedias will eventually turn up. It can be argued that this makes art and museum objects more democratic, as there is not one consigned way of looking at something, everybody contributes to the perception of an image. However, the problem of artist intention, colour and perception still remains. Perhaps this argument is only important when colour is important, but isn’t all colour intentional, and therefore specific? Yves Klein’s International Klein Blue, created so specifically and carefully, varies significantly when <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1000&amp;bih=623&amp;q=yves+klein+international+blue&amp;oq=yves+klein+in&amp;gs_l=img.3.0.0i24l5.1593.4233.0.5347.13.11.0.0.0.0.215.780.6j1j1.8.0...0.0...1ac.1.7.img.ai9x1v-oXiM" title="Yves Klein International Blue - Google Search">searching in Google Image</a>. We all perceive images differently, however, when the image is itself presented differently, what are our perceptions then?</p>

		<p>I didn’t want to overwhelm you all with a tonne of theory, however, if you’re interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader-response_criticism" title="Reader-response criticism - Wikipedia">Reader Response Theory</a> (in which the author/artist becomes absent), I thoroughly recommend that you read Roland Barthes’ <a href="http://www.tbook.constantvzw.org/wp-content/death_authorbarthes.pdf" title="The Death of The Author - Roland Barthes">‘The Death of The Author’</a> (Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/philippickering" title="Phil Pickering (philippickering) on Twitter">Phil Pickering</a> for pointing this out!)</p>
		<p>The article title refers to Walter Benjamin’s seminal piece <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/benjamin.htm" title="Walter Benjamin’s ‘The World of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction">‘The Work of Art in the age of Mechanical Reproduction’</a>, which discusses the art in terms of reproduction and imitation, and talks about the role of mass-media in the politics of the image. His words are particularly applicable and relevant to the online image:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>In principle a work of art has always been reproducible. Man-made artifacts could always be imitated by men. Replicas were made by pupils in practice of their craft, by masters for diffusing their works, and, finally, by third parties in the pursuit of gain. Mechanical reproduction of a work of art, however, represents something new. </p>
