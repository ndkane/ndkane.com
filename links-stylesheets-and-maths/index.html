		<h2>Once more unto the breach…</h2>
		
		<p>At the end of the last lesson, I made ndkane.com a real, live, website. I was very proud that I hadn’t given up, or exploded into a big neurotic mess at the task of learning about getting it out in the open. As Aral demonstrated, you don’t have to know everything off by heart, there’s (almost) always a simple, step-by-step introduction to anything. Of course, as also mentioned by Aral, it would be nice if it was a one-click operation, but you can’t win every time. So after navigating my way onto the internet, it was time to make things a lot less ugly.</p>

		<h2>The Good, The Bad, and The Typographically Ugly.</h2>

		<p>The next task involved the merits of good typographical practise. Before this lesson I had absolutely no idea that there was an ‘em’ dash, what a ‘hyphen minus’ was, or that there was a difference between quotation marks. I definitely didn’t realise how important they are in web development, particularly once you have noticed the difference. Paying attention to these nuances are the difference between a quality website and an average one. Aral emphasised the importance of considering this, as it shows a measure of integrity and attention to detail that is really valued in web development. It reads with more fluidity, and much more naturally. I learnt that if these behaviours are identified at the very beginning, when creating content, it creates a much better attitude to bring to web development in general. It also makes it easier to do it as you go along, rather than going through the entire document (which I had to do to any posts prior to this knowledge. It wasn’t much fun).</p>

		<p>Therefore, I learnt that Alt, Shift and ] was the keyboard shortcut for the closing curly quote, whilst Alt and ] for the opening curly quote. I also realised the difference between elipses (... and …) and the many forms of dashes. Hyphen-Minus (-) doesn’t look as good as an em Dash (—), and there is also an en Dash (–). There are many dashes. However, as mentioned, choosing the most typographically suitable is important in terms of consistency and good practise in web development. Knowing these has made me realise the craftmanship that goes behind web development.</p>

		<h2>Linking it all together.</h2>

		<p>After being very proud that I had finally published something to the internet myself, I realised that the url was pretty messy. Therefore Aral taught me about directorys. However, at first he got me to think about how I would do this, and after several wrong answers (including renaming the html file, which was the most sensible option I tried…) we arrived at the right one. After identifying the default page as any file named ‘index.html’, Aral showed me that by creating a new directory with a cleaner title such as ‘/hello-world’, containing the html page within it and then renaming the html file as index.html, a much better url showed.</p>

		<p>I also needed to link each page to each other, which also meant I had to figure out how to get anywhere! So I already knew that to get back to the first page, I had to direct to the beginning, the root, so therefore an a href link would only need to indicate ‘/’ to get back to the start. So how did I get between pages? This proved remarkably simple once I’d been given the basic rule. To get between pages, I had to direct back to the root directory and then to the parent directory where the page was held. And because my pages were all contained within the server, I only had to type ‘/pagename’ in order to indicate towards this page. This seems simple now, however I hadn’t made this link previously, hence my inability to figure this out at first. Part of this journey is making these connections that weren’t intuitive to me. This has become one of the more challenging parts of this project.</p>


		<h2>CSS (Not the band, although they are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y70ip5jd-GM" title="The band, CSS performing Alala on YouTube">rather good.</a>)</h2>

		<p>If you’d seen the earlier incarnations of ndkane.com, you would have seen that it was pretty scrappy. You physically had to turn your head left to right in order to read it on a large screen, which is pretty uncomfortable, no matter how limber you are. It was pretty rubbish. This is when Aral taught me about measure, font style and creating lists, and therefore CSS. Before embarking upon this project, I was rather scared of CSS. I assumed it was a rather scary, complicated, daunting programming language and no way lent itself to common sense.</p>

		<p>I was wrong. It is actually a lot of common sense, and simple once you’ve figured out the basic shell and the purpose of css tags. We started by creating the style sheet, which is the set of rules for my website. These rules apply to every page, and as I’m learning, I’ve found myself asking how to break the rules. Typical eh? I’d like to figure out how rules in the stylesheet can be changed, for instance, I’d made a list in my first post, so Aral taught me how to order this with the li and ol tags.<a id="footnote-1-origin" href="#footnote-1" class="footnote">1</a> It so happened that I wanted the list items to be alphabetical rather than numerical, so within the style sheet we changed the list style type to ‘lower-alpha’. However, there are other lists I’d like to make or use, such as at the bottom of this post, which might call for numerical lists. So that’s another thing to add to the list of ‘Questions for Aral’.</p>

		<p>The next thing to look at was font, and therefore we changed the default webfont to Helvetica, a personal favourite, however I would like to look at other slightly warmer typefaces. I knew that PCs don’t recognise Helvetica, therefore I was taught to put in an order of preference according to operating system, adding Arial, and then indicate towards any sans serif font after that. We then went through line height and max-width (the constraints put on the text so that it doesn’t stretch across the site), which format the page so that it doesn’t scare people when they visit. This brought up a new unit of measurement that I had never heard of. I had only ever heard of pixels, so when Aral showed me Em as a measurement, I was a bit puzzled. An Em is 16 pixels, 2 Ems is 32 pixels and so on. So with this newly acquired knowledge, adding the appropriate values in Ems, I made my site a lot less offensive to the eye.</p>

		<h2>MATHS (dun dun dun)</h2>

		<p>I won’t go too far into this yet, but as we were learning how to code an outline for my bullet points we encountered a new problem - hexidecimals. I wanted to change the colour of my border, however my only knowledge of doing so was that ffffff was white, and 000000 was black. That was it. I didn’t really cotton onto the fact that they were divided into RGB channels, and even what hexidecimal really meant. Aral first asked me to change the colour and brightness of the border by manipulating the hexidecimals. Aral is pretty good at keeping things simple, however maths, rather than logic, has always been the largest hurdle in my formal learning. He explained that Hexidecimal is so: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f, and therefore was base 16. Therefore, lightening a dark grey to a light grey involves using this system as a scale. The hardest part was understanding the concept of bases, and how to figure out a number/colour just by the hexidecimals presented. I’ll have to refresh my memory by asking Aral about this, as I’ve just tried to explain it before deleting it all, as it didn’t make sense to me. Look forward to more unsolveable Maths-based muddles from me in the future!</p>

			<p id="footnote-1"><span class="footnote">1</span> I’ve already encountered a problem that I’m going to ask Aral. How to give examples of tags without them working within the code. For example, when I tried to give examples of the ‘li’ and ‘ol’ tags with the actual tags, I tried to use the ‘code’ tag and ended up turning my post into a listed coded monster. I’d also like to learn how to make this superscript text smaller. <a href="#footnote-1-origin" class="footnote-origin-link">↩</a></p>
