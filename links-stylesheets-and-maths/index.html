		<h2>Once more unto the breach…</h2>
		
		<p>At the end of the last lesson, I’d made ndkane.com a real, live, website. I was very proud that I hadn’t given up, or exploded into a big neurotic mess at the task of learning about getting it out in the open. As Aral demonstrated, you don’t have to know everything off by heart, there’s (almost) always a simple, step-by-step introduction to anything. Of course, as also mentioned by Aral, it would be nice if it was a one-click operation, but you can’t win every time.</p>

		<p>The next task involved the merits of good typographical practise. Before this lesson I had absolutely no idea that there was an ‘em’ dash, what a ‘hyper minus’ was, or that there was a difference between quotation marks. I definitely didn’t realise how important they are in web development, particularly once you have noticed the difference. Paying attention to these nuances are the difference between a quality website and an average one. Aral emphasised the importance of considering this, as it shows a measure of integrity and attention to detail that is really valued in web development. It reads with more fluidity, and much more naturally. I learnt that if these behaviours are identified at the very beginning, when creating content, it creates a much better attitude to bring to web development in general.</p>

		<h2>CSS (Not the band, although they are rather good.)</h2>

		<p>If you'd seen the earlier reincarnations of ndkane.com, you would have seen that it was pretty scrappy. You physically had to turn your head left to right in order to read it on a large screen, which is pretty uncomfortable, no matter how limber you are. It was pretty rubbish. This is when Aral taught me about measure, and therefore CSS. Before embarking upon this project, I was rather scared of CSS. I assumed it was a rather scary, complicated, daunting programming language and no way lent itself to common sense.</p>

		<p>I was wrong. It is actually a lot of common sense.</p>
