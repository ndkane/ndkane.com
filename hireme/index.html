						<h1>Why I want this job</h1>

						<p>It is vitally important that the relationship between the public and digital culture remains fluid and open, and recognises the barriers that halt dialogue and prevent communication. Developments such as the Open Source movement in development and design, and online activities ranging from Project Gutenberg to Wikileaks have hugely helped towards the development of a digital community that is curious, exploratory and necessary.</p>

						<p>I want this job because this is what I want to be doing. It engages with my compulsion to encourage and develop an open dialogue with the public about digital culture. I have watched Lighthouse closely for the last few years, from volunteering at Jan Hendrickse’s piece ‘Dislocation’, to the recent curatorial direction that has introduced me to the work of Trevor Paglen, Mariele Neudecker and James Bridle. I am genuinely excited to see the future progress of Lighthouse’s programme, and would be honoured to be part of it.</p>

						<h1>Digital Culture &#8202;—-&#8202; The Grand Unveiling</h1>
						<p>Digital culture has sought to find ways of revealing hidden technologies and phenomena, making the invisible visible, and communicating concepts that have previously remained below the surface. This ‘unveiling’ is particularly crucial at a time when tensions between the public, companies and governance, and personal security are creeping into the foreground.</p>

						<p>Digital culture has increasingly found ways of exploring this dialogue by exposing and demystifying these processes, methods and technologies, while highlighting their critical significance within contemporary culture. Increasingly, digital culture is shifting its focus to The Future, where the relationship between technology and society is a subject for scrutiny, exploration and analysis.</p>

					<div class="text">
						<h1>Education and early experience</h1>
						<p>My experience of event management started small, during university I organised panel discussions and talks in my role as Women’s Officer, and then went on to larger events, such as inviting the NUS to co-curate a one-day LGBT conference on campus. At this time I was also a part-time In-house promoter at a local music venue, The Fat Fox, where I organised a number of gigs and events. These first experiences are where I learned the basis of skills essential to project management such as health and safety, risk assessment, acquiring various licenses and contractor invoices, and staff management which I brought into my future arts project management.</p>

						<p>I have always been passionate about audience engagement and understanding the relationship between art and the public, both from a curatorial perspective and an arts facilitator. My literature degree, and year undertaking Masters research allowed me to grasp the critical concerns of subject-object relations, which I later researched for my own personal academic interest, particularly the politics of arts participation and the ethics of spectatorship. I believe I can bring these research skills and a conscientious perspective to curation and accompanying programme required of this role.</p>

						<h1>Working With Institutions</h1>
						<p>Two years ago I volunteered to invigilate at Fabrica, and then later at Lighthouse.These are crucial experiences that allow me to understand how the public engage with work, and the critical issues that arise when exploring that relationship. I am also involved with other roles such as Technical Production, where I worked alongside Melanie Manchot, The Otolith Group, Kaarina Kaikkonen, and will be working with Susie McMurray at the end of June. </p>

						<p>I also devise the interpretation workshops at Fabrica alongside Jane Fordham, the arts facilitator, where I work alongside a small team to deliver workshops that engage the public with the existing installation. Through my work with Fabrica, I have had the opportunity to run workshops at Young People’s Centre, Nacro and with Young Oasis.</p>

						<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
						<p>In January 2012, I decided to develop my own project, <a href="http://blankslateuk.tumblr.com" title="">Blank Slate</a>, in order to open and explore the dialogue that occurs between the public and contemporary art. This involved staging a series of exhibitions that centred largely on audience interaction and engagement, as I wanted to allow the public to become active members in the interpretation process, rather than passive subjects. In June 2012 we staged our first exhibition ‘INTERFACE’ in Jubilee Square, where work based on the distorted and augmented body was presented and a programme of talks, interpretive activities and workshops was devised. We planned for a production in April 2013, however due to a lack of funding, we were unable to produce a professional, quality exhibition, and therefore placed the exhibition on hold.</p>

					<div class="text">
						<p>My role as Creative Director involved curation and project management, managing a small team of Technical Production, Press and PR staff, plus several wonderful volunteers. I developed and managed a solid budget over both projects, and filed an evaluation report after INTERFACE for future funding applications.</p>

						<p>Through Blank Slate, I have had experience writing fundraising applications and exploring options to generate income for the project, including the Brighton and Hove Arts Partnership, the Paul Hamlyn foundation and the Arts Council. I have met with the Arts Council at several stages of my application, both before and after a decision was reached, in order to understand the necessary requirements and demands desired for acceptance. Although we were unsuccessful in our first application, I have developed an understanding of arts fundraising, and hope to bring these skills to this role.</p>

						<h1>Nacro</h1>
						<p>I have been volunteering as a BTEC Art and Design mentor since January 2013, as I was introduced to Nacro through my work with Fabrica. Nacro is a crime prevention charity that specialises in introducing young people with challenging circumstances back into education. I believe this gives me a great perspective from which to devise accompanying programmes, as I think it is important for arts institutions to seriously consider the specific needs of marginalised audiences.</p>

					<div class="text">
					<h1>Web Development and Design</h1>
					<p>I have always had an interest in learning web design and development, and through working with UX designer and programmer Aral Balkan, I have become competent in HTML5, CSS3 markup, Responsive Web Design and Semantic Web Standards. Though I am still learning (I suspect everyone is), I have taken on small projects and clients.</p> 
					<p>I also regularly attend conferences and meet-ups to talk to and hear from designers and developers who work at an Industry standard. I have also attended Seb Lee-Delisle’s CreativeJS workshops, where I learnt JavaScript, and the creative capabilities of coding. This June will be assisting him with his interactive installation <a href="http://seb.ly/work/lunar-trails/" title="Lunar Trails | Seb Lee-Delisle">Lunar Trails</a>.</p>

					<h1>So, Why Me?</h1>
					<p>As an artist, emerging curator, arts facilitator and web designer I believe I have a unique perspective on the contemporary developments and concerns of technology, science and culture.</p>

					<p>Through my work both with the web community and through arts organisations, I have developed excellent contacts locally and nationally, and have made it my mission to talk loudly and openly with the connections I make.</p>

					<div class="text">
					<p>Although I am at an emerging point in my career, I am eternally curious and passionate, and therefore look forward to learning and developing within an organisation with such a strong reputation.</p>

					<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
