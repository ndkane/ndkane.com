		<h2>Fixing last week’s problems…</h2>

		<p><a href="http://ndkane.com/grids/" title="ND Kane - Grids">Last week</a> I mentioned problems with the margins between my list items in unordered and ordered lists. I wanted to change them as any list item that were longer than one line just looked cluttered. I’d been making the mistake of adding the margins onto the lists themselves, rather than the items. This was easily fixed by tweaking the &lt;li&gt; element. I’ve been learning to use Safari’s Web Inspector more and more, rather than just guessing!</p>

		<p>I also wanted to solve the padding on tables, as before nothing that I applied in the CSS would change the top padding. This I taked through with Aral, after inspecting the elements. After a bit of experimentation we found that anything I applied to &lt;tr&gt; would have no effect. Only padding on &lt;td&gt; would apply! Problem solved. While we were looking at tables, we came across pseudo-classes.</p>

		<h2>Pseudo-Classes, or How to Organise Your Children</h2>

		<p>My tables needed a bit of jazzing up. Keeping them in a block light grey didn’t really look very nice, and weren’t very clear. Therefore I needed to look at pseudo-classes so that I could apply alternating colour in the cells. Pseudo-classes, in simple terms, is applying a selective rule to the application of an element.</p>

		<p>Here’s the code as it appears in my stylesheet:</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-css">tr
{
  background-color: #CDCDCD;
}

tr:nth-child(2n)
{
  background-color: darkgrey;
}

tr:not(:last-child)
{
  border-bottom: 1px solid darkgrey;
}</code></pre>

		<p>Here you can see that we set the table rows to be #cdcdcd, and then set a pseudo-class later in the order for every other (starting at the second) cell to be a darker grey. You can also set it differently, so that rather than setting a ‘base’ color and then using a pseudo-class to override it, the initial selector would be a pseudo-class, instead defining the nth child as 0n, from the first cell, then every other. However, it makes sense to do it the way that we’ve set it, as it’s simple to order in the CSS.</p>

		<p>I’ve also shown the selector for the row border, which uses the <code>not:</code> selector, indicating that the border should apply to every cell but the bottom table row. I’ll be playing with these as we go along, applying them to other selectors now that I’ve understood the format.</p>

		<h2>Navigation</h2>

		<p>Everyone needs a bit of direction, so I decided it was time to sort out my navigation. The website you see before you is the most up-to-date version, and therefore you’ll notice a few things that we fixed in later lessons. However, one of the main problems with navigation was the reponsiveness of my website after adding it. I aligned my navigation to fit the max-width (in pixels) of my page by using the first-child pseudo-class, keeping it to the right. This meant that only the first item would have a larger margin, pushing with it the others. However, this broke my site, and made it look worse than it does on mobile! We’re going to fix this next week, as I don’t want to embarrass myself in front of all my new RWD friends.</p>

		<p>I also created a list item class ‘<code>.current</code>’ to use within navigation to clearly indicate with an underline what section the reader was in, as I’ve created a new section where I talk about the other love in my life, <a href="/art">Art</a>. I’d like to revise this once I’ve looked a little harder at Design.</p>

		<h2>A note on Rubber Ducks, and how to find solutions</h2>

		<figure><img src="images/rubber-ducks-felix63.jpg" alt="Rubber Ducks by Felix63 on Flickr"><figcaption>Lots of Rubber Ducks, by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/flex/" title=" Felix63's Photostream on Flickr">Felix63</a></figcaption></figure>

		<p>Aral has instilled within me the motto ‘Think about the solution first, then find the code’. As coding is pretty much a completely new thing to me, I’m not always going to instinctively know the answer. However, I will be able to demonstrate how I’d like to get there, or what I’d like to do. Also, I’ve learnt there’s no harm in trying, or failing, because it just means you can try something else.</p>

		<p>One tip that friend and super-technologist <a href="http://nataliabuckley.co.uk" title="Natalia Buckley's Online Portfolio">Natalia Buckley</a> passed on, was that of Rubber Ducking. It’s a good way of finding solutions by making yourself think out loud. Essentially you have a Rubber Duck, or whatever small mascot you can find, and you talk your problems through with them. I don’t mean problems like what to have for lunch, rather for asking questions like ‘Why won’t my navigation headers stay where I want them to?’. Then you explain what you’ve tried, and where you could go next, then try it, and ask again if it fails. Natalia mentioned that often you’ll unconsciously find the solution because you hadn’t considered something. This is working for me, however at the moment I don’t have a rubber duck, just a rather bemused pair of cats.</p>

		<h2>Homework</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Redesign the programme page of <a href="http://www.eva-london.org/past-eva-londons/past-eva-londons/2012" title="2012 | EVA London">EVA London Conference</a>. I’ll be posting the versions and commentary on my <a href="/redesigns">Redesigns</a> page.</li>
			<li>Do some reading! Aral has given me the W3 CSS3 specifications on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#UIstates" title="CSS3 Pseudo-classes">Pseudo-classes</a> to mull over, and a chapter to read by David Storey and Lea Verou from <a href="http://www.smashingbook.com" title="The Smashing Book #3">The Smashing Book #3: Redesign The Web</a>, entitled ‘Restyle, Recode, Reimagine With CSS3’.</li>
			<li>Look at Design and Colour Pallettes, using <a href="http://www.pictaculous.com" title="Pictaculous - A Color Palette Generator">Pictaculous</a>, <a href="https://kuler.adobe.com" title="Kuler">Kuler</a> and <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com" title="Color Trends + Palettes: COLOURlovers">Colour Lovers</a>.</li>
			<li>Look at the &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;header&gt; tag.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Next week we’ll be looking at Responsive Web Design, so that my website doesn’t look like Frankenstein’s monster when you’re reading it anywhere other than your trusty laptop.</p>

		<p>Også, min favorit dansk ord er chokoladekage, og i engelsk ‘Chocolate Cake’ (it’s pronounced ‘shock-o-lather-kye-a’).</p>
