		<h1>Redesigns - EVA London</h1>

		<p>I came across the Electronic Visualisation and the Arts website when I was looking for conferences that I wanted to plan for this year. Over the last year or two I’ve found myself going to more conferences, symposiums or seminars as it’s often the best place to encounter new ideas, or even meet new people interested in what you’re interested in. I wanted to get a good idea of what to expect from EVA this year, so I took a look at their <a href="http://www.eva-london.org/past-eva-londons/past-eva-londons/2012" title="Past EVA Londons | EVA London">previous programmes.</a></p>

		<p>My main criticism was to do with how easy it was to read the page, as there was no distinguishable visual hierachy. The Serif font also made it difficult to read as the line height wasn’t substantial enough to let it read easily.</p> 

		<p>So here’s what I did:</p>

		<p>First things first, in order to override any of the instructions given by the original CSS stylesheet I had to create my own. Therefore I created my own and placed it just before the &lt;/head&gt;. I then laid out a very simple grid, working on a body base line—height of 24px. This made it easy for me to work out my hierachy of headlines.</p>

		<p>As mentioned previously, there wasn’t much distinction between headlines, therefore, working from the base line height that I had set in the body, I created a hierachy. It seemed that rather than applying specific classes to the same headline (e.g. “h2.italics”) they had just used the next headline in the order to apply the rules. This also allowed me to set margins for the headlines, which got rid of all of those pesky &lt;br /&gt;!</p>

		<p>Talking of &lt;br /&gt;, when I first started experimenting with code in my teens, hacking at my MySpace page until it was unrecognisable, I used them A Lot. This seems the case here, and although I’ve been told that in xhtml, this is fine, in HTML5 it doesn’t hold up. I’ve got very used to working in a way that allows me to control my elements without using another specifically for the job, which I can then apply rules for. I hope that makes sense! As I neatened up the code, I found many, so we’re not on the best terms at the moment.</p>

		<p>I also changed the font to match the rest of the page, I can understand the need for two fonts as part of a sites specific design, but in this case, it was easier to read if it was changed to Helvetica, the main font in the surrounding columns.</p>
