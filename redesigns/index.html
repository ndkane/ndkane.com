		<p>Ever since embarking on my journey into Content Out Web Development and Design, I have become all the more aware of other websites. Therefore, this page is my attempt at understanding better web design.</p>

		<p>As Aral has prewarned, I am opening myself up to response, and I imagine that not all of it will be positive. This is not meant to be a scathing critique of websites that annoy me, but rather a helpful nudge towards a different way of thinking. Not only in terms of accessibility, but general readability. If your visitor finds themselves struggling to read your website, then they aren’t going to read all the wonderful things you’ve written. The websites I’ve chosen are those that I have happened upon, and found difficult to read.</p>
